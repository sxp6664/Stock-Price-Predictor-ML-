# ML Stock Price Predictor

## Project Description
This project involves developing a sophisticated machine learning model for predicting stock prices. It utilizes time-series analysis and feature engineering techniques to achieve high accuracy. Advanced algorithms such as LSTM and Random Forest are implemented using Python libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. The model is deployed on a cloud platform (AWS/GCP) for scalable and real-time stock price prediction.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Follow instructions in `data/README.md` for data setup.
4. Run Jupyter notebooks in `notebooks/` for data exploration and model development.

## Usage
- `data_preprocessing.py`: For data cleaning and preprocessing.
- `feature_engineering.py`: For feature engineering.
- `model_training.py`: For training the machine learning model.
- `model_evaluation.py`: For evaluating the model.
- `deployment.py`: For deploying the model on a cloud platform.
